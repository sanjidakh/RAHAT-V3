## [2.1.0] - 2025-04-24

### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling in Bot Restart**:
  - Added detailed logging in the `/api/restart` endpoint to track the restart process step-by-step.
  - Improved `stopBot()` function with proper cleanup of Express server and database connections.
  - Added checks to ensure `serverInstance` and `db` exist before attempting to close them.
- **Retry Mechanism for Sending Messages**:
  - Added a retry mechanism in the frontend (`index.html`) for the "Send Message" feature, which attempts to restart the bot if the API instance is not initialized.
  - Logs detailed responses in the browser console for easier debugging.
- **Session Timeout for Security**:
  - Added a session timeout feature in the dashboard that logs out users after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- **Bot Status Monitoring**:
  - Added a periodic check (`checkBotStatus`) in the dashboard to monitor bot responsiveness every 30 seconds, logging warnings if the bot appears disconnected.
- **Restart Confirmation**:
  - Added a confirmation dialog in the dashboard to prevent accidental bot restarts.

### Changed
- **Dashboard Updates**:
  - Improved the dashboard UI with better error feedback:
    - Added console logging for all API responses (restart, send message, update config) to help debug issues.
    - Added a preloader during restart and config updates to improve user experience.
    - Ensured the settings UI reloads the config after saving to reflect the latest changes.
  - Updated the sidebar to be more responsive, automatically expanding on larger screens and collapsing on mobile unless manually expanded.
  - Modified the "Send Message" feature to handle API instance issues gracefully with retries.
  - Updated the "Settings" section to force a UI refresh after saving, ensuring the displayed values match the updated `config.json`.
- **Logging Improvements**:
  - Enhanced logging in `index.js` to provide more context during bot startup, shutdown, and API interactions.
  - Added intermediate logs in the restart process to track progress and failures.

### Fixed
- **Failed to Restart Bot**:
  - Resolved issues with the bot restart process by improving error handling in `stopBot()` and `startBot()`.
  - Fixed potential issues with database connection closure and Express server shutdown.
- **Failed to Send Message**:
  - Fixed the "API instance not initialized" error by adding a retry mechanism that triggers a bot restart if needed.
  - Improved error logging to identify specific FCA API issues (e.g., invalid thread IDs, authentication failures).
- **Settings Not Updating**:
  - Ensured the `/api/update-config` endpoint writes to `config.json` reliably with proper error handling.
  - Fixed UI issues by reloading the config after saving, ensuring the dashboard reflects the updated settings.
  - Added a restart trigger after config updates to apply the new settings immediately.
